#### Exercise 1.4: Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

```eval-scheme
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b) ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```

a plus the absolute value of b is a plus b if b is greater than 0, otherwise is a subtract b.
