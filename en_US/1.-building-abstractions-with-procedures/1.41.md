# 1.41

## Exercise 1.41: Define a procedure double that takes a procedure of one argument as argument and returns a procedure that applies the original procedure twice. For example, if inc is a procedure that adds 1 to its argument, then (double inc) should be a procedure that adds 2. What value is returned by

```
(((double (double double)) inc) 5)
```

```eval-scheme
(define (double f) (lambda (x) (f (f x))))

(define (inc x) (+ x 1))
((double inc) 1)
```

```eval-scheme
(((double (double double)) inc) 5)
```
