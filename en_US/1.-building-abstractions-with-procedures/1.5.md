# 1.5

### Exercise 1.5: Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the in- terpreter he is faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:

```eval-scheme
     (define (p) (p))
```

```eval-scheme
(define (test x y)
       (if (= x 0)
                0
                y))
```

### Then he evaluates the expression

```text
(test 0 (p))
```

### What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal- order evaluation? Explain your answer. \(Assume that the evaluation rule for the special form if is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.\)

`(test 0 (p))` gives `0` if normal-order is used; the program hangs if applicative-order is used.

Because `(p)` is pointed to itself which introduces an infinite interpretation loop. And in normal-order the error will have no chance to expose since the `0` circuit is triggered first.

## Notice: This Gitbook uses `klipse` plugin to run the inlined scheme code, and under the hood it uses [`biwascheme`](https://github.com/biwascheme/biwascheme) to interpret the code, which is actually using applicative-order, so I disabled the running for

```text
(test 0 (p))
```
